\section*{Introduction}
Generally, the path to becoming a lead developer on an open source software (OSS) project starts by contributing to existing OSS projects. Once becoming a lead developer on a large project, we would expect the developer to reduce contributions to other projects in order to focus energy on leading their own project. Utilizing the publically accessible Github API, we will collect data on the largest open source projects, such as Numpy and JupyterNotebooks.
